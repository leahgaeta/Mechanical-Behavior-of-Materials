# Mechanical Behavior of Materials
This repo includes study materials and some programs from my Mechanical Behavior of Materials course taught by [Professor Scott Bunch](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/scott-bunch/) at Boston University (ME 582). 

**Notes Include:**
- [Mechanical Behavior of Materials Overview](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Mechanical-Behavior-of-Materials/raw/main/Mechanical%20Behavior%20of%20Materials%20Overview.pdf)
- [Structures, Defects, and Deformations of Materials Overview](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Mechanical-Behavior-of-Materials/raw/main/Structures%20Defects%20Deformation.pdf)
- [Mechanical Testing Overview](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Mechanical-Behavior-of-Materials/raw/main/Mechanical%20Testing.pdf)
- [Reference Sheet I](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Mechanical-Behavior-of-Materials/raw/main/Reference%20Sheet%201.pdf)
- [Reference Sheet II](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Mechanical-Behavior-of-Materials/raw/main/Reference%20Sheet%202.pdf)

**Programs Include:**
- [Finding principal normal and shear stresses and their directions](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Mechanical-Behavior-of-Materials/blob/main/Prin_norm_shear_direction.m)
- [Finding shear stress experienced in a thick-walled tube](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Mechanical-Behavior-of-Materials/blob/main/thick_walled_tube.m)
